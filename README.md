# Dictionary_App
 A dictionary app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for GitHub would be a web-based application that allows users to search for words and get their meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and examples of usage. 

The app would use JavaScript to perform the search and display the results dynamically on the web page. HTML and CSS would be used for structuring and styling the app respectively. The app would be hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy collaboration and version control.
